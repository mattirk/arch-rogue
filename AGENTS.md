# Arch Rogue — Agent Brief

## Project Vision

Arch Rogue is a modernized take on the classic Rogue formula: a dark, dangerous, replayable dungeon crawler presented as an isometric action RPG inspired by Diablo II. The game should preserve Rogue's procedural depth, permanent consequences, discovery, and tension while introducing modern combat feel, progression systems, accessibility, and presentation.

## Core Pitch

- **Genre:** Isometric action RPG / roguelike dungeon crawler
- **Inspirations:** Rogue, Diablo II, classic dark fantasy dungeon crawlers, modern ARPG quality-of-life systems
- **Camera:** Fixed or semi-fixed isometric perspective
- **Theme:** Grim fantasy, ancient ruins, cursed depths, occult treasures, hostile wilderness, and underground labyrinths
- **Session Style:** Replayable runs with meaningful progression, procedural maps, unpredictable loot, and high-stakes decisions

## Optimization
Analyze, write, and optimize game code to maintain a stable 60+ FPS while preserving readability, input responsiveness, and clear combat feedback.

## Technology
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Game Engine:** Pygame CE: https://pypi.org/project/pygame-ce/ 

## Current Code Organization

Keep the prototype architecture modular but intentionally small:

- `src/arch_rogue/game.py` owns the main loop, input handling, gameplay orchestration, combat/interactions, audio/options setup, and the executable `main()` entry point.
- `src/arch_rogue/rendering.py` owns the `RenderingMixin` for dungeon, actor, effect, HUD, and menu-overlay drawing behavior used by `Game`.
- `src/arch_rogue/audio.py` owns mixer setup, procedural sound effects, and per-run procedural NES-style background music generation.
- `src/arch_rogue/save_system.py` owns the `SaveLoadMixin` for item serialization, run-state serialization/restoration, and save-file lifecycle behavior used by `Game`.
- `src/arch_rogue/story.py` owns deterministic story generation, story-state serialization helpers, guest construction, and choice-effect aggregation used by `Game` and saves.
- `src/arch_rogue/constants.py` owns shared gameplay/rendering constants and lightweight aliases.
- `src/arch_rogue/content.py` owns prototype content tables such as archetypes, dungeon themes, run modifiers, enemy definitions, equipment definitions, traps, shrines, secrets, and the dark fantasy story corpus.
- `src/arch_rogue/models.py` owns lightweight gameplay data models and shared simple types such as actors, items, projectiles, rooms, tiles, story beats, and guests.
- `src/arch_rogue/dungeon.py` owns procedural map generation and dungeon collision/floor queries.
- `src/arch_rogue/sprites.py` owns procedural pixel-art sprite construction.
- `src/arch_rogue/menus.py` owns reusable menu and overlay rendering helpers.

Prefer expanding these focused modules until a new boundary is clearly justified. Avoid introducing many narrow submodules during prototype work.

## Design Pillars

1. **Rogue at the Core**
   - Procedural dungeon generation
   - Risk/reward exploration
   - Scarce resources
   - Dangerous unidentified items
   - Permanent or semi-permanent consequences
   - Emergent problem solving over scripted solutions

2. **Diablo II-Style Game Feel**
   - Real-time combat with pause option
   - Distinct character archetypes
   - Loot-driven progression
   - Isometric presentation
   - Skill builds and equipment synergies
   - Dark fantasy atmosphere

3. **Modern Mechanics**
   - Clear combat telegraphs where appropriate
   - Smooth input handling
   - Strong controller and mouse/keyboard support
   - Readable UI and inventory management
   - Build diversity without excessive complexity
   - Optional meta-progression that does not remove run tension

4. **Replayability First**
   - Procedural levels, encounters, loot, events, traps, shrines, and bosses
   - Multiple viable playstyles
   - Meaningful choices during each run
   - Secrets, rare events, and surprising item interactions

## Initial Gameplay Goals

### Exploration

- Generate dungeon floors with rooms, corridors, chokepoints, secrets, hazards, and themed regions.
- Reward careful exploration with loot, shortcuts, lore fragments, and hidden encounters.
- Include classic roguelike uncertainty through unidentified potions, scrolls, relics, curses, and traps.

### Combat

- Use real-time isometric combat rather than turn-based movement.
- Prioritize readable enemy behavior, positioning, cooldowns, and tactical movement.
- Support melee, ranged, magic, traps, summons, and hybrid builds.
- Encourage decision-making through stamina, mana, cooldowns, durability, consumables, and enemy resistances.

### Progression

- Characters should gain power through:
  - Experience and levels
  - Skills and passive talents
  - Equipment and affixes
  - Relics or artifacts
  - Temporary run-based blessings, curses, or mutations
- Preserve danger by ensuring progression creates options rather than guaranteed safety.

### Loot

- Loot should be exciting, readable, and build-defining.
- Include item rarity tiers such as common, magic, rare, unique, cursed, and legendary/artifact.
- Support affixes inspired by ARPGs: damage types, resistances, lifesteal, cast speed, movement speed, thorns, proc effects, summons, and skill modifiers.
- Cursed items should be tempting, not merely bad.

## Character Archetypes

- **Warden:** Durable melee fighter with shields, counters, guard breaks, and armor mastery.
- **Rogue:** Fast striker using daggers, bows, traps, poison, evasion, and critical hits.
- **Arcanist:** Spellcaster using elemental, arcane, curse, and teleportation magic.
- **Acolyte:** Dark priest using sacrifice, healing, spirits, blood magic, and undead control.
- **Ranger:** Mobility-focused ranged class using bows, beasts, snares, and terrain control.

## Example Skill System Direction

Skills should support both active abilities and passive modifiers. Prefer flexible build paths over rigid linear trees.

Example categories:

- **Combat Skills:** Cleave, Shield Bash, Backstab, Multishot, Firebolt, Frost Nova
- **Mobility Skills:** Dash, Blink, Shadowstep, Leap, Vault
- **Control Skills:** Slow, Root, Fear, Knockback, Stun, Silence
- **Survival Skills:** Guard, Barrier, Lifesteal, Regeneration, Dodge, Cleanse
- **Summoning Skills:** Skeleton, Familiar, Totem, Spirit Guardian
- **Utility Skills:** Identify, Disarm Trap, Reveal Secret, Town Portal, Enchant Item

## World and Atmosphere

- Tone should be dark, mysterious, and dangerous rather than heroic power fantasy only.
- The dungeon should feel ancient, hostile, and reactive.
- Lore should be discoverable through items, shrines, enemy factions, environmental storytelling, and rare NPC encounters.
- Avoid excessive exposition during gameplay; preserve mystery.

## Development Guidelines

- Build systems modularly so procedural content, combat, items, and skills can evolve independently.
- Prefer data-driven definitions for items, enemies, skills, affixes, rooms, events, and loot tables.
- Keep early prototypes focused on feel: movement, combat readability, loot feedback, and dungeon traversal.
- Avoid overbuilding meta-progression before the core run loop is fun.
- When choosing between authenticity to Rogue and modern playability, preserve the spirit of Rogue while modernizing the interface and moment-to-moment feel.

## Current Milestone

### 2.3: Run Structure, Bosses, and Long-Term Replayability

- Add stronger floor-to-floor run pacing with meaningful transitions, escalating threat, biome/theme variety, and previewable risks before descending.
- Introduce memorable mini-bosses and floor bosses with distinct silhouettes, attack patterns, telegraphs, loot hooks, and story/theme ties.
- Expand procedural encounter composition with faction mixes, elite packs, ambushes, environmental hazards, treasure rooms, and rare event templates.
- Improve run identity through modifier combinations, cursed bargains, branching objectives, optional challenge rooms, and discoverable secrets.
- Add lightweight meta-progression that unlocks options, records discoveries, and rewards mastery without reducing the danger of individual runs.
- Build out end-of-run summaries with cause of death, notable loot, defeated bosses, story choices, discovered secrets, and performance stats.
- Strengthen save/load and run-resume coverage for multi-floor progression, boss states, discovered lore, unlocked options, and active modifiers.
- Add more monsters with varying attack patterns, loot hooks, and story/theme ties
- Add more player skill upgrades with distinct skill trees, passive modifiers, and active skill effects.
- Profile dense boss and encounter scenarios to preserve 60+ FPS with clear input response, combat readability, and stable procedural generation costs.

## Next Milestone

### 2.4: Content Depth, Presentation, and Accessibility Pass

- Expand biome, room, enemy, boss, loot, shrine, trap, and story-event variety so repeated runs produce more distinct tactical and narrative situations.
- Add richer dungeon presentation with stronger biome palettes, landmark rooms, environmental storytelling props, improved boss arenas, and clearer danger silhouettes.
- Improve accessibility and readability through configurable keybindings, scalable UI refinements, colorblind-safe combat cues, clearer status explanations, and stronger controller affordances.
- Deepen audio and feedback with biome-specific music motifs, boss stingers, loot rarity sounds, low-resource warnings, and more readable hit, block, dodge, and proc confirmation.
- Add stronger player guidance through an optional codex, discovery log, run-history records, boss bestiary entries, and concise explanations for unlocked systems.
- Expand meta-progression cautiously with discovery-based unlocks, cosmetic or option-expanding rewards, and challenge modifiers that preserve per-run danger.
- Improve content authoring quality with validation for content tables, duplicate names, unreachable event hooks, invalid affixes, boss definitions, and save-compatible unlock data.
- Strengthen performance and memory profiling for long sessions, repeated restarts, dense effects, large inventories, and multi-floor save/load cycles.
- Add regression tests and deterministic simulations for accessibility options, content-table validity, presentation scaling, codex/unlock persistence, and run-history summaries.
