# Arch Rogue — Project Skill Brief

## Project Vision

Arch Rogue is a modernized take on the classic Rogue formula: a dark, dangerous, replayable dungeon crawler presented as an isometric action RPG inspired by Diablo II. The game should preserve Rogue's procedural depth, permanent consequences, discovery, and tension while introducing modern combat feel, progression systems, accessibility, and presentation.

## Core Pitch

- **Genre:** Isometric action RPG / roguelike dungeon crawler
- **Inspirations:** Rogue, Diablo II, classic dark fantasy dungeon crawlers, modern ARPG quality-of-life systems
- **Camera:** Fixed or semi-fixed isometric perspective
- **Theme:** Grim fantasy, ancient ruins, cursed depths, occult treasures, hostile wilderness, and underground labyrinths
- **Session Style:** Replayable runs with meaningful progression, procedural maps, unpredictable loot, and high-stakes decisions

## Optimization
Analyze, write, and optimize game code to maintain a stable 60+ FPS while

## Technology
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Game Engine:** Pygame CE: https://pypi.org/project/pygame-ce/ 

## Design Pillars

1. **Rogue at the Core**
   - Procedural dungeon generation
   - Risk/reward exploration
   - Scarce resources
   - Dangerous unidentified items
   - Permanent or semi-permanent consequences
   - Emergent problem solving over scripted solutions

2. **Diablo II-Style Game Feel**
   - Real-time combat with pause option
   - Distinct character archetypes
   - Loot-driven progression
   - Isometric presentation
   - Skill builds and equipment synergies
   - Dark fantasy atmosphere

3. **Modern Mechanics**
   - Clear combat telegraphs where appropriate
   - Smooth input handling
   - Strong controller and mouse/keyboard support
   - Readable UI and inventory management
   - Build diversity without excessive complexity
   - Optional meta-progression that does not remove run tension

4. **Replayability First**
   - Procedural levels, encounters, loot, events, traps, shrines, and bosses
   - Multiple viable playstyles
   - Meaningful choices during each run
   - Secrets, rare events, and surprising item interactions

## Initial Gameplay Goals

### Exploration

- Generate dungeon floors with rooms, corridors, chokepoints, secrets, hazards, and themed regions.
- Reward careful exploration with loot, shortcuts, lore fragments, and hidden encounters.
- Include classic roguelike uncertainty through unidentified potions, scrolls, relics, curses, and traps.

### Combat

- Use real-time isometric combat rather than turn-based movement.
- Prioritize readable enemy behavior, positioning, cooldowns, and tactical movement.
- Support melee, ranged, magic, traps, summons, and hybrid builds.
- Encourage decision-making through stamina, mana, cooldowns, durability, consumables, and enemy resistances.

### Progression

- Characters should gain power through:
  - Experience and levels
  - Skills and passive talents
  - Equipment and affixes
  - Relics or artifacts
  - Temporary run-based blessings, curses, or mutations
- Preserve danger by ensuring progression creates options rather than guaranteed safety.

### Loot

- Loot should be exciting, readable, and build-defining.
- Include item rarity tiers such as common, magic, rare, unique, cursed, and legendary/artifact.
- Support affixes inspired by ARPGs: damage types, resistances, lifesteal, cast speed, movement speed, thorns, proc effects, summons, and skill modifiers.
- Cursed items should be tempting, not merely bad.

## Candidate Character Archetypes

- **Warden:** Durable melee fighter with shields, counters, guard breaks, and armor mastery.
- **Rogue:** Fast striker using daggers, bows, traps, poison, evasion, and critical hits.
- **Arcanist:** Spellcaster using elemental, arcane, curse, and teleportation magic.
- **Acolyte:** Dark priest using sacrifice, healing, spirits, blood magic, and undead control.
- **Ranger:** Mobility-focused ranged class using bows, beasts, snares, and terrain control.

## Example Skill System Direction

Skills should support both active abilities and passive modifiers. Prefer flexible build paths over rigid linear trees.

Example categories:

- **Combat Skills:** Cleave, Shield Bash, Backstab, Multishot, Firebolt, Frost Nova
- **Mobility Skills:** Dash, Blink, Shadowstep, Leap, Vault
- **Control Skills:** Slow, Root, Fear, Knockback, Stun, Silence
- **Survival Skills:** Guard, Barrier, Lifesteal, Regeneration, Dodge, Cleanse
- **Summoning Skills:** Skeleton, Familiar, Totem, Spirit Guardian
- **Utility Skills:** Identify, Disarm Trap, Reveal Secret, Town Portal, Enchant Item

## World and Atmosphere

- Tone should be dark, mysterious, and dangerous rather than heroic power fantasy only.
- The dungeon should feel ancient, hostile, and reactive.
- Lore should be discoverable through items, shrines, enemy factions, environmental storytelling, and rare NPC encounters.
- Avoid excessive exposition during gameplay; preserve mystery.

## Systems to Consider Early

- Procedural dungeon generation
- Character controller and isometric movement
- Combat interaction model
- Entity/component or similar gameplay architecture
- Inventory and equipment system
- Item generation and affix database
- Skill and effect system
- Enemy AI and behavior trees/state machines
- Save/run state model
- UI framework
- Input abstraction for keyboard/mouse and controller

## Development Guidelines

- Build systems modularly so procedural content, combat, items, and skills can evolve independently.
- Prefer data-driven definitions for items, enemies, skills, affixes, rooms, events, and loot tables.
- Keep early prototypes focused on feel: movement, combat readability, loot feedback, and dungeon traversal.
- Avoid overbuilding meta-progression before the core run loop is fun.
- When choosing between authenticity to Rogue and modern playability, preserve the spirit of Rogue while modernizing the interface and moment-to-moment feel.

## Initial Milestone Suggestion

### Prototype 1: Core Dungeon Loop

Deliver a minimal playable loop with:

- One character archetype
- One procedurally generated dungeon floor
- Basic isometric movement
- Basic melee and ranged enemy combat
- Health, resource, and death states
- A few lootable items
- Simple inventory/equipment
- Exit stairs or boss room objective

### Prototype 2: Build and Loot Identity

Expand with:

- Multiple skills
- Item affixes
- More enemy types
- Traps and shrines
- Consumables and unidentified items
- First unique items

### Prototype 3: Replayability

Expand with:

- Multiple dungeon themes
- Boss encounters
- Character archetypes
- Run modifiers
- Secrets and rare events
- Stronger UI/UX polish

## Open Design Questions

- Should death be full permadeath, soft permadeath, or run-based with account/meta progression?
- How far should the left-mouse movement and keyboard-skill control scheme be expanded for controller support?
- Should the game be single-player only initially, or architected with future co-op in mind?
- How close should itemization stay to Diablo II versus a leaner roguelike inventory model?
- Should levels be fully procedural, handcrafted room chunks, or a hybrid?
