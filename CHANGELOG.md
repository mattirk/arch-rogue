## 1.0.0 — Public Release

Arch Rogue 1.0 stabilizes the existing 10-depth single-player run loop for public release.

### Added

- Class identity pass with starting equipment and signature-feeling advantages for Warden, Rogue, Arcanist, Acolyte, and Ranger.
- Atomic, versioned run-state writes with user-visible failure text stored on the `Game` object for resume/save failures.
- Persistent options saved to `~/.arch_rogue_options.json` for audio, fullscreen, and UI scale.
- Release metadata in package/version strings and title screen.
- Public release README sections for requirements, install/run, controls, known issues, credits, and release notes.

### Changed

- Depth pacing now keeps early floors lighter and ramps late-floor enemy pressure.
- Enemy durability and damage scale modestly by depth.
- Trap damage scales modestly after early depths.
- Title/about/options copy now targets the 1.0 public release instead of the beta test loop.

### Known Issues

- Music toggle is present for settings persistence, but no soundtrack assets are bundled.
- Keyboard/mouse input is the supported control scheme for 1.0.
- Procedural placeholder presentation remains intentionally lightweight.
